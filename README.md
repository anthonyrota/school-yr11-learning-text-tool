# Learning Text Tool

## Task Description

You are a new programmer and looking for a full-time job. To demonstrate your programming
and documentation skills you develop an educational tool. The documentation associated with
the educational tool is crucial to convince a future employer that you are worth employing.

In this task, you are to create an educational tool to assist students in years 7 - 8.
The subject areas which can be covered are:

- [ ] Maths
- [ ] Geography
- [ ] History
- [ ] Science

### The requirements of the educational tool:

- [ ] Introduction and information about the tool
- [ ] Instructions on how to use the tool
- [ ] User input with correct outputs and feedback
- [ ] Give students information about upcoming sections/questions
- [ ] The educational tool has a minimum of 20 questions
- [ ] The question difficulty increases as the user progresses
- [ ] Text-based only, written in Python
- [ ] Includes a scoring system

See below marking criteria for further information

### Documentation

- **Flowchart:** Design a complete flowchart that represents your educational tool.
  See NESA Course Specifications for standard flowchart symbols.
- **Logbook:** All progress is documented in the logbook using the template given. Providing
  insight into all the work completed, including challenges, achievements and references.
